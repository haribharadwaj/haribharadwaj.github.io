        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for sudden hearing loss to reduce inflammation, in hopes of protecting the inner ear from permanent damage. On this basis, multiple studies have been done looking at the protective property of intratympanic corticosteroids in relation to acoustic trauma. I picked two articles that addressed this question. The first article (Investigation of the Cochlear Effects.) exposed rats to 110 dB white noise for 8 hours then injected methylprednisolone 2 hours after the trauma. DPOAEs were recorded before and after the exposure, and then each cochlea’s hair cell count was recorded. The results found that the experimental group retained more hair cells than the control group after acoustic trauma. Also, by 2 weeks, the DPOAE amplitudes of the control and experimental group were equivalent. This suggests that, while hair cells were protected by the corticosteroid, the effect on hearing is uncertain. The second article (Assessment of the efficacy.) exposed guinea pigs to a 100 dB 5 kHz tone for 1 hour, then injected dexamethasone in a slow releasing gel. ABR thresholds were recorded before and after the exposure. They found that by 30 days, the control and experimental groups had all fully recovered their ABR thresholds. This suggests this corticosteroid/gel solution had no protective effect on the guinea pigs hearing after the noise exposure. Together, these articles conclude that while there is promise for corticosteroids as a protective agent against acoustic trauma, more research must be done.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) is used as an objective approach to monitor ototoxicity. Earliest signs of damage to the cochlea can go undetected using conventional DPOAE measures due to various variabilites. This presentation aimed to find articles to help identify the most effective techniques and considerations to enhance the reliability of DPOAEs in detecting toxic damage early. Scheperele, et al., 2008, investigates the influence of situ sound-level calibration on variability in DPOAEs. This study compared calibration techniques by using two sensitivity DPOAE level to probe insertion depth, “deep” and “shallow”. This study found that DPOAEs measured using SPL calibration showed greater changes and variability of changes across frequency and stimulus level than using SIL or FPL calibrations when the probe-insertion depth was manipulated. Additionally, this study found that probe placement effects all calibration methods, especially measuring above 4kHz. Poling, et al., 2019, investigates the utilization of DPOAEs to monitor ototoxicity in individuals undergoing chemotherapy treatments. DPOAEs were measured across frequencies and clinical scenarios in adult patients undergoing platinum-based therapies, advocating for enhanced clinical practices by utilizing high-frequency stimuli, improved calibration techniques for stability in serial measurements, and targeted monitoring protocols to evaluate outer hair cell function. There is further research needed to optimize DPOAE protocols, compare DPOAEs and clinical outcomes, and for this research to be replicated and validated by other researchers to be used clinically. Calibration methods, probe placement, temperature effects, and discussing implementing new methods are all considerations in enhancing reliability in using DPOAEs to monitor ototoxicity.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>Veterans are exposed to noises and aromatics that are unique compared to the general population. Some of these sources include weapons, explosive devices, and jet fuel. It is often forgotten that noise is not the only ototoxic substance Veterans are exposed to. It has been hypothesized that exposure to specific fuels, such as JP-8, can have adverse effects on the peripheral and central auditory nervous system (CANS). Warner and colleagues aimed to identify and analyze the current knowledge on the combined effects of exposure to JP-8 jet fuels and noise on the CANS in the Veteran population by conducting a literature review (Warner et al., 2015). Additionally, Fuente and colleagues aimed to investigate the potential adverse effects of JP-8 exposure on the peripheral and/or central auditory system using 57 participants from the Australian air force (Fuente et al., 2019). Overall findings suggest that there is an association between aromatic solvents, including jet fuel, in combination with noise and auditory dysfunction. Warner and colleagues found effects on peripheral and central auditory function (Warner et al., 2015), whereas Fuente and colleagues found effects on peripheral auditory function (no evidence of chronic central auditory nervous system dysfunction associated with jet fuel was found in this study) (Fuente et al., 2019). Both researchers determined that further research is needed to assess the effects of combined exposures to jet fuel and noise on the CANS.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> During our first lecture, we were introduced to the impact of hearing loss on employment and the economy.  In the United States alone, it is estimated that reduced productivity and employment from hearing loss results in a loss of about $280 Billion annually (Bharadwaj, 2023).  This staggering fact piqued my interest of the economic burden of occupational hearing loss (OHL) specifically, which led to the review of articles focused on Worker’s Compensation claims and hearing conservation approaches in industry.  Studies show that OHL results in both intrinsic and monetary costs, such as reduced quality of life, social isolation, reduced earnings, and increased healthcare costs.  Submitted claims for Worker’s Compensation, which provides often provides partial wage replacement, have shown that OHL results in millions of dollars’ worth of payouts each year across the United States, with the highest number of claims resulting from the Manufacturing industry.  Additional cross-sectional studies determined that there is often poor adherence to noise standards in industries, resulting in high rates of occupational hearing loss and Worker’s Compensation claims.  Such studies support the fact that individuals with the highest risk of OHL require particular attention to prevent hearing loss, through noise monitoring programs, hearing conservation efforts, and personal hearing protection devices. There is a substantial economic burden of hearing loss in industry, which can be used as a catalyst to encourage industries to abide by stricter hearing preservation programs.  Further studies should aim to address the observance of stricter hearing conservation methods and the resulting trend of Worker’s Compensation claims.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> For musicians, hearing loss can be very detrimental to their careers or enjoyment. Their loudness perception, frequency discrimination, pitch perception, timbre perception, and speech perception can all be affected by hearing loss due to noise exposure. While performing, musicians are surrounded with sound from monitors, themselves, instruments, and crowds. Floor and in-ear monitors are the most common, but in-ear monitors have started becoming more popular due to their role in reducing noise exposure. In-ear monitors have been found to attenuate sound up to 19.7 dB as Federman found in his study (Federman, 2008). However, in-ear monitors can have an occlusion effect from the ear monitors being similar to ear plugs. In his study, Federman tested in-ear monitors’ actual role in hearing prevention by allowing musicians to set a personal listening level as well as a minimum acceptable listening level. He then measured their performance and analyzed the data. Through his analysis, he found that there was a difference in the results between using floor monitors and in-ear monitors. In-ear monitors blocked approximately 6 dB more sound than a floor monitor which resulted in a significant change in the exposure time. This increase of exposure time will help musicians be able to practice and perform without as much noise exposure damage. Being able to study and put numbers on equipment can help other musicians become more aware and practice better hearing prevention.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Hearing loss and tinnitus are the two most commonly awarded service-connected disabilities in the Veteran community. Therefore, prevention and rehabilitation of hearing loss and tinnitus are of utmost priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Comprehensive Ototoxicity Monitoring Program for Veteran Patients receiving cisplatin (COMP-VA) is a reliable protocol in order to predict, keep track of, and treat hearing threshold shifts during cisplatin treatment. It proposes a testing approach that includes a baseline (prior to cisplatin treatment) evaluation, monitor evaluations before each cisplatin treatment (at the oncology ward using portable audiometers and DPOAE’s), and a followup evaluation after the final treatment is completed. It is often most convenient for the patient to conduct monitor evaluations during hydration just before the next cisplatin administration. If a hearing change is discovered, this allows the oncologist to have some time to consider treatment changes. Post treatment protocol evaluations should be conducted as soon as possible so audiological changes can be addressed in a timely manner.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Gene therapy is a possible way to regenerate hair cells (HC).  This can be accomplished through direct transdifferentiation of support cells (SC) into HC, or by triggering cell proliferation resulting in a new SC and HC.  Research largely has focused on using Atoh1, as this is the first transcription factor involved in HC differentiation in development.  Limited success has been found using Atoh1 with an adenovirus (Ad) or aden-associated vector (AAV) as the vehicle.  Due to the lower immune response found with AAVs, future trials will focus on AAV.  Because of the limited success of Atoh1, other transcription factors in addition to Atoh1 were trialed.  Trials involving Atoh1 with Gfi1, Atoh1, Gfi1 and Pau4f3, Atoh1 and Ikzf2, and Atoh1 and Pax2 were all found to result in HC transcription.  Even with these successes, gene therapy still faces many barriers.  An important one is the multiple genes and pathways involved in HC differentiation during development.  As a result, multiple genes will likely be needed to address this in gene therapy.  Leading to the next challenge, a vector.  The vector must be able to carry the load and have a low immune response.  Finally, animal models need to be used to develop possible clinical protocols. Overall, gene therapy has promise, but no current clinical use.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Aminoglycosides are broad-spectrum antibiotics often prescribed for severe infections such as sepsis. They are overall known to be ototoxic, but a comparison of how they compare in cochleotoxicity and vestibulotoxicity is warranted. A meta-analysis by Nakashima et al. (2000) offers a review of aminoglycoside ototoxicity, details how the drugs are absorbed by the inner ear, and introduces research into mitochondrial mutations as a risk factor for ototoxicity. It provides a ranking of aminoglycoside cochleotoxicity and vestibulotoxicity. A review by Bates (2003) describes mechanisms for ototoxicity and pharmacokinetics of aminoglycosides, and introduces antioxidant and iron chelation therapy as options for ototoxic protection. Overall, netilmicin is the least vestibulotoxic and cochleotoxic. Gentamicin, kanamycin, dibekacin are the most ototoxic. Both articles provide evidence that suggest basal hair cells are more vulnerable than apical hair cells, crista ampullaris are more vulnerable than macula utriculi, and them more so than macula sacculi. A direct relationship exists between the dose of the aminoglycoside and damage to the cochlea and vestibular system.

NIOSH and OSHA have dose levels that are recommended by them for appropriate exposure to noise. For musicians specifically, most hearing protection devices can be discouraging to wear due to factors like the occlusion effect, physical fit, and attenuation levels. This presentation reviews published articles that investigate how effective frequency specific HPDs are. The first article selected goes about addressing this by proposing an active HPD that reduces the occlusion effect and compensates for the isolation effect. These authors found that their prototype HPD was able to decrease the perception of the occlusion effect by about 10dB, but noted that more human subject testing is needed. The second article selected goes about addressing this by testing 3 different types of available HPDs through personal attenuation rates measured using the REAT method and by collecting survey results over 6 months. These authors found that there is no one "best" musician HPD; rather the frequency of wearing such devices depends on physical fit, instrument played, and circumstances in which they played. These findings contribute to the field of audiology by providing insights on how we can better implement frequency specific hearing protection devices.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> It is well known that musicians are more susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss because of their loud profession. High-fidelity earplugs (custom or non-custom) are presented as an option for musicians because they will attenuate sound evenly across all frequencies. However, many performers don’t wear them due to perceived changes in the quality of the music. This presentation aims to see what the current literature says about musicians or high-fidelity earplugs. Between the two studies examined, spectral analysis, Real Ear Attenuation Threshold, and surveys were used to test various musicians' plugs objectively and subjectively. The individual results vary between studies, but both found that the earplugs impact music perception. Custom and non-custom plugs cause distortion in the music that impacts the ability of the musician or performer to get the true sound—concluding that musicians’ earplugs do not attenuate evenly across frequencies.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>Synaptopathy can be a result of noise exposure that is caused by the damage of synapses from the inner hair cells. Patients with synaptopathy may have complaints of hearing loss but may present with normal hearing thresholds. The article I reviewed evaluated how neurotrophins may be used as a treatment immediately following noise exposure to prevent and treat synaptopathy. Animal models are being used to study these effects, and this study exposed two groups of guinea pigs to 95 dB SPL of noise, and 105 dB SPL of noise and then immediately provided a treatment of a Neurotrophin bolus to one ear of each guinea pig with a saline solution acting as the control in the contralateral ear. ABR amplitudes were used to track changes from baseline through 2 weeks post-intervention and exposure. The results indicated that there was a recovery in the ABR amplitudes in the neurotrophin ears of the 95 dB noise group, and no significant recovery in amplitudes in the other groups. Ribbon Synapse Analysis showed that despite the noise exposure levels, there’s a significant increase in synapses in the neurotrophin ears vs. the control ears. These results can lead to the overall conclusion that with future research, neurotrophins could be a clinical treatment for preventing and treating synaptopathy. Future research could evaluate the length of treatment, what specific neurotrophins may have the best therapeutic effect, and at what level may there be too much noise exposure where the neurotrophin may not have an effect.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Teachers spend most of their days in noisy classrooms but are often forgotten about when looking at occupational noise exposure. Most research on classroom noise exposure investigates the impact on students. However, teachers are exposed to this level of noise daily for several years while they teach. The purpose of this presentation is to investigate the impact that classroom noise levels can have on teachers’ auditory health as well as their overall wellbeing. The question being asked in this presentation is: What effect does noise exposure have on teachers in the classroom? The two articles assessed look into the impact on teacher’s auditory health as well as their overall wellbeing. The first article used questionnaires to assess the teachers’ perceived impact of the noise they’re exposed to (CITE). This looks at the teachers’ overall wellbeing as well as their desire to continue teaching. The second article used DPOAE and classroom sound level readings to assess how noise exposure damaged their outer hair cells (CITE). DPOAEs can be used as early indicators of cochlear damage, so they can help indicate an early decline in hearing health. This study was objective and looked at the physical impacts of noise on their bodies. Both studies show the long-term impacts of classroom noise exposure reveal damage to teachers’ hearing as well impacts to their overall wellbeing. More research is needed to assess both physical and psychological impacts of noise on teachers.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>Musicians are exposed to loud sounds every day. This presentation attempts to find an answer to the question: What considerations should be made for musicians in order to conserve their hearing? These two articles complete research looking at musicians’ use of Hearing Protective Devices (HPD). The first article used surveys, hearing screenings, and education to determine if prevention programs would be beneficial to music students (Savividou et al., 2021). Researchers wanted to see what the awareness was for hearing health and what percentage of participants wore HPD. The second article uses surveys, baseline audiograms, three types of HPDs audiograms, and education to see if one type of protective device would be better than another for musicians in different environments (Crawford et al., 2022). Researchers were looking to see which type of HPD was best in certain situations, as well as cost, comfortability, etc. Effectiveness was the main goal of the study. The results in both of these articles give insight into different considerations that should be made for musicians in order to conserve their hearing. Further research opportunities include using different models and manufacturers of HPDs to determine more differences, and using different screening methods for testing a participant’s hearing such as otoacoustic emissions.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Potassium is an ion that plays a large role in the ionic potential of the cochlea. Without potassium in the cochlea, auditory signals could not be delivered to spiral ganglion neurons. Could changes in potassium affect hearing, even if those changes were small enough to be caused by diet? Researchers in Korea aimed to investigate the relationship between potassium intake and hearing level. Using the KHNANES survey data, authors gathered information from each participant, evaluated their potassium intake 24 hours before the assessment, and then determined their hearing thresholds across the frequency range. Several statistical analyses were applied to this data, and the researchers derived that there was a positive relationship between potassium intake and lower levels of hearing loss. Although there were some limitations to the article including whether or not confounding variables influenced hearing levels, narrow selection of participants, and the inability to determine causality, I found this information useful and could be applied to future research questions. Additionally, if we can determine this association between potassium and hearing level, we can potentially provide new recommendations to our patients whose goals are preserving and protecting their hearing.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> This presentation aims to address the long-term effects of noise exposure on the central auditory system. The research article by Eggermont, 2017, evaluates this topic by assessing the known effects of long-term exposure to non-traumatic noise on the animal brain, and combining it with evidence from humans. Animal studies used three different levels of noise - traumatic noise (>105 dBA), threatening noise (>80 dBA), and assumed safe noise (<80 dBA) - to assess the central auditory effects that resulted from each. Evidence from human studies encompassed findings of auditory processing effects in those with clinically normal hearing sensitivity who were exposed to varying levels of noise. The results revealed that noise exposure of ≤80 dB SPL causes changes in the midbrain, thalamus, and cortex while still resulting in normal hearing sensitivity. These changes occur in frequency response patterns shown by the reorganization of tonotopic mapping, disruption in spontaneous firing rates, and reduced central gain. The effects directly manifest themselves into the temporal processing and speech understanding abilities of individuals exposed to noise. Given the findings of this article, the noise spectrum and intensity level of work environments should be monitored frequently and raising awareness of the central auditory effects is warranted. The authors also suggested that conducting speech in noise testing and audiometry up to 12kHz can aid in detecting changes of hearing outside of the standard measurements that are typically used.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Majority of pregnant woman continue to work until one month before their due date. Occupational noise can be an everyday risk factor for both working pregnant women and their fetus, as the maturing cochlea is highly sensitive to sound waves. The current research review dives deeper into the relationship between in-utero noise exposure and neonatal hearing screening results. Selander et al. (2016) explored the relationship between maternal occupational exposure to noise during pregnancy and hearing dysfunction in their children. Factors such as maternal work status, educational experience, different levels of occupational noise exposure (dBA), and hearing dysfunction reports for their child were analyzed using the cox proportional hazards regression. Results revealed the most frequent jobs with the highest noise exposures were musicians, carpenters, and butchers. Highly exposed mothers tended to be younger and less educated. Due to these factors, mild hearing loss could be induced by occupational noise exposure to the fetus in-utero. Morimoto et al. (2016) evaluated the effects of noise exposure on neonatal auditory brainstem response thresholds in pregnant guniea pigs. Pregnant guniea pigs were exposed to pure tone stimuli at a high intensity level during the different gestational states. Postnatal ABR thresholds and latencies were evaluated for the newborn guniea pigs. Results proved noise exposure influences ABR thresholds in neonatal guniea pigs. Further research is needed to confirm noise exposure effects on humans in-utero, although predictions are high that noise exposure in the mother’s womb can cause hearing differences outside of the womb.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>Exposure to high levels of sound in the environment can cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), which is one of the most common causes of hearing loss. Preventive measures can be taken for NIHL. Preventative measures may include engineering and administrative controls and hearing protection, but these can be costly and used incorrectly. This presentation aimed to find articles that would increase the understanding of whether certain dietary supplements, including antioxidants, have an otoprotective action against NIHL. Abbasi et al., 2021, conducted a systematic review of twelve studies that evaluated vitamin and antioxidants’ relationship with NIHL in adults. This study found inconsistent otoprotective results for Vitamins E, C, and A and significant protective effects for Vitamin B12, Folic Acid, and NAC. Pisani et al., 2023 tested antioxidant enzymes to determine their protective and attenuation abilities against NIHL in animal models. This article found polyphenols, Vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10, and NAC effective against NIHL due to their ability to counteract Reactive Oxygen Species and attenuate hearing loss. This research revealed antioxidants were more effective for otoprotection against NIHL due to their ability to reduce oxidated stress and block free radicals. Since many factors influence the effectiveness of supplements/antioxidants, further research is needed in human studies to determine when they should be given for the best protection and if there are long-term effects. Overall, these results reveal using dietary supplements and antioxidants against NIHL is a promising area.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>It is well known that aminoglycosides cause hearing loss and much research has been conducted on the effects of these aminoglycosides. There is not as much research on the ototoxicity effects of non-aminoglycoside antibiotics. A literature review and case study were reviewed to determine the effects of non-aminoglycoside antibiotics. The literature review determined non-aminoglycoside antibiotics cause auditory and vestibular ototoxicity, but more research needs to be conducted to determine the mechanisms in which this occurs. The case study specifically focused on the antibiotic, erythromycin, and reported that hearing loss occurred in a patient due to the administration of erythromycin. It is important to be aware of these ototoxicity effects in non-aminoglycosides as well as aminoglycoside antibiotics.
