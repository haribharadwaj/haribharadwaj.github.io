          <strong>Abstract: </strong>Gait is the manner of walking or the analysis of each step when walking. It can be used to determine if the person has abnormalities in their walking and it is important in analyzing how a person should walk if they are missing a limb. There are different phases in gait. These are separated based on time of occurrence. Each gait cycle includes two periods which are stance and swing phase. Stance phase accounts for 60% of the total time for one step and is when both feet are on the ground. Swing phase, accounts for 40% of the total step time and is when the feet is in midair. Stance phase of gait is divided into loading response, midstance, terminal stance, and pre-swing. Swing phase is divided into initial swing, mid-swing, and terminal swing. It is rare to find gait data that has classified each gait phase, although it’s important in understanding the muscular condition of a patient. In this project, one of the objectives was to preprocess EMG data by smoothing it then labelling it the corresponding gait phase associated with it. The second objective was to make predictions of how a person should walk on the other foot given the manner of walking on the right foot. The results show that a good classification was made, and the prediction had a Mean Squared Error of 25.25 and r2 score of 0.29 on a small dataset of one subject walking for less than 40 second.
