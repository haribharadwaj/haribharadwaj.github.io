  <p>  Welcome to the <strong>Final Project Showcase</strong> page for the Fall 2021 edition of <strong>BME 511 Biomedical Signal Processing</strong>, at the <a href="http://engineering.purdue.edu/BME"> Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering </a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/"> Purdue University</a>. BME 511 is a biomedical "data-science" course covering the application of signal processing and stochastic methods to biomedical signals and systems. While orientation to biomedical data is key to this course, the tools and concepts covered provide foundational skills that are useful in many domains. This course is distinct from other classic offerings in ECE/MA/STAT in at least three ways:
  <ol>
      <li> Relevant theory in signal processing and statistical methods is covered as needed, but a major focus is on implementation/application of the fundamental techniques to real-world biomedical signals. </li>
      <li> Statistical methods that are typically taught with a "univariate" perspective are expanded to topologically organized high-dimensional data such as time-series and images, and done so motivated by the needs in biomedical applications (e.g., electrophysiology, neuroimaging). </li>
      <li> This course uses practical applications to integrate probabilistic methods (e.g., estimation, detection, filtering) with classic linear-algebraic tools (e.g., Fourier/wavelet transforms, PCA, noise cancellation/regression). These foundational areas are often introduced in separate courses, but are powerful when brought together.</li>
  </ol>
  A "hands-on" approach is taken throughout the course via application-oriented problem sets. The course also includes a pre-defined <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/haribharadwaj/notebooks/blob/main/BME511/MidtermProject.ipynb" target="_blank">midterm project (brain-computer interface)</a>, and a self-selected final project (last 5 weeks). One important goal of the final project is to gain <i>independent</i> experience applying the tools/concepts to a real-world application of each student's interest. For more information about the overall course, please see the <a href="https://github.com/haribharadwaj/syllabi/blob/main/PurdueBME511_BiomedSigProc.md" target="_blank">syllabus</a>.

        <strong>Abstract: </strong> Parkinson’s Disease affects nearly every part of the body as this neurodegenerative disease causes neurons producing the neurotransmitter dopamine to gradually die off, reducing communication levels within the brain. Early, noninvasive diagnostic methods for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are needed to better manage symptoms and potentially slow disease progression long-term. A recent study by Iravani et al. (2021) shows the potential for using noninvasive electrodes to monitor the common early symptom of olfactory bulb dysfunction and potentially diagnose PD earlier than current PD diagnostic methods that rely on motor symptoms. The objectives of this final project are to confirm the results of this study by identifying features in the electrode recordings that accurately distinguish between PD patients and healthy controls, developing a logistic regression model that uses these features to differentiate between PD patients and healthy controls with reasonable accuracy, and evaluate the correlation between the identified features and disease progression descriptors. To achieve these aims, a total of six key features were isolated from spectrogram representations of the electrode recordings and logistic and linear regression models were fit to the features and the various outcomes. Logistic models using various combinations of features were able to classify the subjects as PD patients and controls with ~95% accuracy. Key features also appeared to be correlated with the three disease progression descriptors that were evaluated.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Epilepsy, estimated to affect over 50 million people worldwide, is characterized by seizures which occur with little to no advanced external warning. Epilepsy diagnosis from an EEG is generally done by experts by identifying epileptiform discharges, generally characterized as spikes, sharp waves, and other spike-wave type forms. Early detection of an imminent seizure could allow a patient to be in a safe location or possibly take fast-acting seizure preventing medicines, and thus improve their quality of life. Multiple studies have shown that these waveforms are present in increasing quantity during the time leading up to the seizure. This project develops a process to automatically extract spikes and sharp waves in interictal EEG recordings and preictal EEG recordings and count the number of occurrences, generating a smoothed spike rate per observation period. The maximum rate during interictal periods will be calculated and this will be used as a threshold. Other EEG recordings will be processed similarly and compared to the rate of the threshold (per channel). If the EEG recording has a higher rate than the threshold, it indicates that a seizure is imminent. Using this method on a dataset from a Kaggle epilepsy detection competition, the accuracy of prediction for the test subject is above 78%.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>Gait is the manner of walking or the analysis of each step when walking. It can be used to determine if the person has abnormalities in their walking and it is important in analyzing how a person should walk if they are missing a limb. There are different phases in gait. These are separated based on time of occurrence. Each gait cycle includes two periods which are stance and swing phase. Stance phase accounts for 60% of the total time for one step and is when both feet are on the ground. Swing phase, accounts for 40% of the total step time and is when the feet is in midair. Stance phase of gait is divided into loading response, midstance, terminal stance, and pre-swing. Swing phase is divided into initial swing, mid-swing, and terminal swing. It is rare to find gait data that has classified each gait phase, although it’s important in understanding the muscular condition of a patient. In this project, one of the objectives was to preprocess EMG data by smoothing it then labelling it the corresponding gait phase associated with it. The second objective was to make predictions of how a person should walk on the other foot given the manner of walking on the right foot. The results show that a good classification was made, and the prediction had a Mean Squared Error of 25.25 and r2 score of 0.29 on a small dataset of one subject walking for less than 40 second.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> PPG systems can be conveniently built-in wrist watches and rings making it increasingly popular for different applications like heart rate estimation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure estimation. In case of respiratory estimation, it is necessary to detect the pulse peaks within the PPG signal to observe Respiratory Sinus Arrythmia (increase of heart rate during inhalation and decrease during exhalation). However, PPG signal is extremely susceptible to motion artifacts which masks the pulse peaks. To get a robust detection of PPG peak detection, we have implemented and compared the results of 1) bandpass filtering 2) Wavelet decomposition 3) Normalized least mean square (NLMS) adaptive filtering and 4) Recursive least square (RLS) adaptive filtering-based approaches. The PPG signals were acquired from Samsung Galaxy Active2 watch from 28 healthy subjects and simultaneous ECG recordings were acquired from Vitalpatch ECG sensor that has been placed on the chest. The PPG and ECG signals are continuously recorded for 5-7 days, except for the time when the watch was taken off to be charged. The PPG signal is affected by motion artifact induced by a wide range of activities.
          The evaluation of true positive detection is based on the following assumptions:
          1. There is only one true PPG peak between two R-peaks of ECG data.
          2. If the peak detection algorithm detects more than one PPG peaks in between two R-R intervals, the true peak is identified from R-R interval from preceding ECG cycles. The rest of the peaks are labelled as false positive detection.
          The benchmarks of performance are the rate of true positive detections with respect to ECG. The aims for the final project are: Aim 1) reporting the TP rate for all 4 preprocessing techniques for 28 subjects, Aim 2) Lower the false positives in detected PPG peaks, i.e., increase TP rate(PPG) while maintaining a high TP rate (at least 70%) with respect to ECG in 1 subject. The results as of now show that the simplest approach, i.e., bandpass filtering based approach has the best performance with an average TP rate of 53% and TP rate(PPG) of 86%. The reduction of false positive detections using outlier elimination approach did not however work as expected.
          It resulted in an increase in TP rate(PPG) in 2 out of 4 cases but reduced the TP with respect to ECG in all cases. Interestingly, if we modified the peak detection to remove cubing of segments and select appropriate threshold to select outliers, it is possible to get an increase of TP to 62%. So, we have succeeded in fulfilling both the aims of the project.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Arrhythmia detection using the Electrocardiogram(ECG) data is performed
                  through training machine learning models like Logistic Regression and a custom
                  made Deep learning network.Arrhythmia is an abnormality in heartbeat.This is
                  diagnosed by readings taken from EKG,event monitor ,echocardiogram and
                  implantable loop recorder.The data used for this project is from MIT-BIH
                  arrhythmia database.There are 109446 samples with a sampling frequency of
                  125 Hz, also five categories of classes are considered.The classes under the
                  study include, i)Normal beat ii) Supraventricular premature beat, iii)Premature
                  ventricular contraction, iv)Fusion of ventricular and normal beat, v)Unclassifiable
                  beat.First the signal is preprocessed to normalize data and then logistic
                  regression model is applied on the data,as the data is imbalanced, accuracy
                  metric was not able to provide accurate results.Adding nonlinearities to the
                  output of logistic regression,an accuracy of 91% was achievable.After that a
                  custom made neural network was used to achieve a test accuracy of 95.2% with
                  a AUC score( measures the total area underneath the ROC curve) of 0.99. After
                  completion of the model, testing is done on the unseen data in order to quantify
                  the amount of generalization of the model on the data. The accuracy obtained
                  was the same.Also the time consumed for the diagnosis is only seconds.Hence,
                  this simple machine learning method allows a fast retraining of the classifier if
                  new ECG data become available.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Music is known to evoke a range of emotional responses, and thus it can be
                  used for some forms of therapy. In music therapy, the music is chosen to
                  evoke a desired emotion or response, but determining which pieces to play
                  can be challenging, requiring information on both the music and the
                  individual. This project aimed to use a combination of the music’s acoustic
                  properties and EEG measurements to predict music induced emotional
                  responses. Due to time constraints the audio feature extraction was omitted,
                  instead using 2 predefined emotions: ‘sad’ or ‘happy. The participants in the
                  dataset were first presented with different music, labeled with the emotion,
                  then questioned on their emotions. The measured EEG data was
                  preprocessed, and PCA was used to reduce the data and create a classifier to
                  predict the emotional response. The resulting classifier performed poorly,
                  though that was expected because the acoustic features of the music were
                  not included with the EEG data when creating the classifier.

          <strong>Abstract: </strong> Perfect pitch is the rare ability to recognize a note without a reference; relative pitch is the ability to recognize the difference between two or more pitches. Musicians throughout their lifetime
          (those with and without perfect pitch) train their relative pitch, as it helps with harmony, melody,
          and so many more fundamental and advanced concepts that makes music sound the way it
          does. The part of the brain that is responsible for understanding and processing pitch is the
          auditory cortex. The question arose on whether or not it’s possible to compare musicians'
          relative pitch against each other through the use of EEG signals. Experimental eeg raw data
          was taken from Goldman et al. paper on improvisation effect on categorizing musical structures.
          The EEG data of two random subjects in the experiment were preprocessed and compared.
          The results showed that while it was possible to visualize which subject had the better relative
          pitch, it was determined that a classification approach (like AUC or PCA) would be better to
          more easily visualize how good someone’s relative pitch is using EEG data.
